# ♞ Chess Bot ♜

## COP3530 - Project 3
> This project serves to implement and compare two chess engines. One engine uses a minimax algorithm (tree traversal) with alpha-beta pruning to find the best possible move within a certain depth.
> The other chess engine takes an ML approach using tensorflow to find the best move.

## How To Use

> a) Choose to:
> 
>    1) Play against the Minimax Algorithm Chess Engine 🧑‍💻
> 
>    2) Play against the ML Chess Engine 🤖
> 
>    3) Watch the Minimax and ML Chess Engines Play Against Each Other 📺
>
> __NOTE__: If you selected option 1, you will also have to enter a depth. It is recommended that a depth of 1-5 be selected (see Limitations below).
>
> b) In order to play against the ML or Minimax Algorithm Chess Engines, simply enter the position of the piece and the position you would like to move this piece to.

##  Features ♛

♙ Minimax Algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning
>
♙ ML and Minimax Implementations
>
♙ TensorFlow for ML Implementation

## Limitations ♙
♙ No current implementation of en passant nor castling
>
♙ Running this program at depth 1-5 is preferable as a depth >5 will take very long to run
>
   __NOTE__: A run at depth = 5 will still take about 10 minutes per turn. For a faster playthrough, running the board at depth = 2 or 3 is recommended, though this will reduce the skill level of the engine's decision-making
>
♙ No GUI currently implemented
